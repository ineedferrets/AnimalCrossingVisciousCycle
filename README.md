# Wheelchair Experience prototype
Developed by Joseph Hesketh and Cristiana Pacheco

## Concept
This project aims to provide a proof of concept: representing a wheelchair in a Unity environment with the aid of an arduino, to allow wheelchair users to play VR games. To do so, for the prototype, the concept was simpler: create a miniature of a single wheel, "send" its movement information to Unity and use it to spin a wheel object in the scene. The success of such prototype proves that this could easily be reproduced for two wheels and later introduce all other elements of a VR game.

## To Do
Here are things to do on the project in general:
- Add a second wheel in the Arduino code.
- Create a physics based wheelchair in Unity.
- Control the wheelchair with both wheels.
- **Get a wheelchair and spend time living in it.**
- **Speak to wheelchair users about their experiences.**
- Connect the controller to the wheelchair.
- Add VR.
- Design the experience for the wheelchair.
- Implement the experience into a game.
